Outliers may indicate extreme economic conditions in certain years or specific countries, impacting the overall risk assessment.\r\n",

It's essential to investigate these instances further to understand the economic factors contributing to the outliers.\r\n",

    "- **Zscore:**\r\n",
    "  - Zscore exhibits outliers on both ends of the box plot, with a higher concentration on the positive side. Outliers on the positive side may indicate financial institutions with exceptionally strong financial health, possibly due to robust business strategies or prudent financial management. On the negative side, outliers may highlight banks facing financial challenges, warranting a closer examination of their financial structures.\r\n",

Investigating these outliers can provide insights into specific risks affecting certain banks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Liquidity Risk (RL):**\r\n",
    "  - Liquidity Risk has a few outliers, indicating variations in a bank's ability to meet short-term obligations. Outliers may be linked to specific events such as economic crises or changes in banking regulations. Understanding the circumstances surrounding these outliers is crucial for assessing the liquidity resilience of individual banks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Other Metrics:**\r\n",
    "  - The remaining metrics appear to conform within the box plots, with very few or no outliers. This suggests a general consistency in the values of these metrics across the dataset. Any absence of outliers in these metrics implies a relatively stable and uniform performance within the banking sector for those specific aspects.\r\n",

    "By identifying and understanding the outliers in each metric, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing the financial and economic dynamics of the banking institutions in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) countries. Further analysis and contextual information may be required to interpret the outliers accurately."
